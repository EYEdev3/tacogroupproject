    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>Four friends:Erica, Francine, Janet and Juana moved from Chicago
    to the city that never sleeps New York City. We searched for our favorite
    dish and were unable to locate any Korean Tacos in their new city. So they
    came together and started as NYC's very first and most popular Korean Taco
    truck. Tangy Tacos in Mid-Town Manhattan. We serve a delicious combination
    of Korean flavors with a Mexican twist all made from scratch with our own
    recipes. Six years later, and three additional locations in Brooklyn,Bronx
    and Queens.</p>
    
    <h1>Giving Back</h1>
    <p>Tangy Tacos pledges 1% of all gross sales to local environmental, food
    and youth based non-profit organizations. Through this initiative Tangy
    Tacos has made 11 donations to 9 charities and non-profit organizations in
    the NYC area which are having a tremendous impact raising awareness and
    alleviating local environmental issues, supporting community farms
    , providing access to food, and empowering youth through experiential
    learning, outdoor education, and leadership development. Tangy Tacos
    looks forward to supporting more locally run organizations and cultivating
    new meaningful relationships. Visit our Community Giving Blog for more
